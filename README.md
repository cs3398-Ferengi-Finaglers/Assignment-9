# Assignment-9
Jordan - I added the skeleton code for the assignment, I have NOT edited main or anything except for the src files.

Karen - I corrected main and the decorator classes so that the decorators now work correctly ontop of the basic car, was responsible for/editted the PaintColor decorator class, and added three car combinations to main (a basic car, a painted car, and a painted super charged car)

Jacob - I created the repository and was responsible for/edited the air scoop class.
